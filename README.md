# Tableau-presentations
These were my presentation from Tableau that I completed on shipping around the world and CO2 emissions

The first was meant as a presentation to a shipping company to show their profits, costs, and shipping costs per item they deal with. The other presentation was meant to give a general overview on the world CO2 emmisions.
